// SERVER-ONLY Supabase admin client. Uses the service-role key, which BYPASSES RLS.
//
// Never import this from browser code, and never import it at the top level of a
// *.functions.ts file. Inside a server-function handler, import it LAZILY so the
// service-role key can never enter the client bundle graph:
//
//   const { supabaseAdmin } = await import("@/integrations/supabase/client.server");
//
// Reserved for: the Auth Admin API, verified webhooks, and trusted maintenance.
// For ordinary per-user reads/writes use the request-scoped client injected by
// requireSupabaseAuth (see ./auth-middleware) so RLS applies as that user.
